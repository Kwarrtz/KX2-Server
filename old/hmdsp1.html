        Oh mom this is your day,<br>
        let your worries wash away.<br>
        Banish all your tears,<br>
        abolish all your fears.<br>
        Today is your day to to do what you wish,<br>
        today is your day to have fun.<br>
        Today is your day to relax,<br>
        not to worry about getting things done.<br>
        Let your spirit lift,<br>
        free from burdens and chores.<br>
        Be happy and and enjoy the day,<br>
        for this one is yours.<br>
